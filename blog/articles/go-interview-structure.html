Note that this structure is designed for my team where I know the interviewer quite well.</div>
            
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
    
        
        
        
            <p>Answer interview's questions in a structure fashion has never been easy even with experienced developers. This is even more challenged with non-native English speakers like Vietnamese young developers. Sometime candidates talk too much or too little, or even make bad impression to interviewers by saying things they shouldn't say,... Those little things often lead to a failed interview.</p>
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
    
        
        
        
            <p>For young and non-native English speaker developers in Vietnam, we need a simple structure so that they can learn and practice themselves. I created and applied successfully the interview structure below for more than 50 developers for Go developer position. Most of them are fresh graduate with less than 1 year of experience and the success rate of the interviews is more than 97.5%.</p>
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
    
        
        
        
            <p>If you're a young Vietnamese developer who are trying to pass a Go interview, this guideline is for you. The guideline is provided as a template with some very basic rules so that you can use it for practicing with your mentors and easier to make your own styles.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Although the rules listed below are very basic, but a lot of people makes those mistakes. Hence make sure you are very clear the below rules before your interview:&nbsp;</p>

    <li>Be respectful to the interviewers.
    
    </li>

                    
                        
    <li>Listen to the questions carefully.
    
    </li>

                    
                        
    <li>Be clear about your role and what you did in the projects.
    
    </li>

                    
                        
    <li>Don't just say "I know it" and stop. Instead, talk about your real experiences with the technologies in your past projects in full context. And if possible, provide your analysis or comparison with similar technologies.
    
    </li>

                    
                        
    <li>Don't assume that interviewers know your projects or familiar with the domains/technologies in your projects. Instead, provide them a full context of what/when/why and how did you use it.
    
    </li>

                    
                        
    <li>Don't use "we". Instead, use "I" when talking about your experiences.
    
    </li>

                    
                        
    <li>Don't argue with interviewers about why they use a specific technology instead of another one. Instead, ask them about the context that led to the decision of using it.
    
    </li>

                    
                        
    <li>If you don't know a specific technology, don't just say "I don't know". Instead, admit that you have not had a chance to work with it and talk about your experiences with similar technologies.
    
    </li>

                    
                        
    <li>Be honest, be nice and smile.

            <p>There are a plenty of ways to introduce yourself and an overview on what you have worked on.

    </li>

                    
                        
    <li>Tell them at most 2 or 3 relevant projects you've worked on:- Type of project: web, desktop, mobile, API, microservice application?- An overview about the goal/purpose or main features of the project.- Technologies are used in the project.- Your role/what you did in the project.

            <p>When talking about the detail of a project, the general guideline is to go from "overview" to "detail". Talking about the overview first to make sure the interviewers know the big picture of the project, and talking about the detail to show them your deep knowledge of the project.</p>
