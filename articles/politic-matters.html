        <div><p>I was in a team evaluating two frameworks of a technology that would become the core of the majority of applications in a company. I was working with the customer for more than 3 months on that and we're all pretty happy at the time.</p><p>The process of evaluating was quite hard at first since we didn't know much about the technology as well as the selected frameworks, but fortunately we managed to get it done quite well after all. The team and I were happily present the result to the customer in hope he will be happy with what we have done.</p><p>I was the one who presented the result to the customer and it started pretty well with "smiles" and some fancy compliments, until I came into the conclusion that the framework #1 is better than the framework #2. I started recognized that the customer changed his voice, not really angry but sound a little bit unhappy. </p><p>It's strange to me since he was happy at first and we did a good job technically. I was so confused and didn't really know what was wrong. The team did an amazing job and we were correct at the points we're saying.</p><p>After a short silent moment, he started talking with a calm voice that he and his boss worked with the first framework in their last company and they didn't "like" it very much. Hence if the first framework is selected, it'd be rejected for sure. Until this point, I knew that I was fucked up. So, instead of making the second framework looks better than the first one, I did it the opposite way.</p><p>This was really a mess since I were not "smart" enough to realize what the customer wants in the first place and spent a lot of time investigating countless of technical problems. But fortunately, he was a nice guy and still gave us sometime to correct our report. With the knowledge we had, it's quite easy to make a framework looks better than the others in the report. It's easy because most of people in the approval board don't know much about the technology, and some don't even care which one is selected. The most important is what the final boss think.</p><p>After all, it's all about politics in the organization! Some time, technology X is selected instead of technology Y just because someone's boss "like" it. Even he/she cannot explain what it means by "like". And some time, we choose one technology over the other ones just because it will ensure our position or our job within the company.</p></div>
