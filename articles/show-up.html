One just does what he can to protect what he believes in... and the manager's duty is not to criticize but to help them to grow.</div><p>Back in 2010 when I first started the developer job at HCM city, I was assigned to a Java project and I loved it so much. I loved the way it was designed. I loved each line of its code and became aggressive with anyone who tries to put bad code into the project. That was a big project, there were many good developers and also some not so good. Some of them put bad code into the areas that I was responsible for.</p><p>After so many times, I became angry and as a result, I fired an email to the entire team to complain. There were people who shared the same feelings with me but also there were some people who disagreed, especially the senior ones. The disagreements were not about what I wrote, but about their ego. My manager at the time asked me to write an email to apologize to the entire team (especially the seniors ones) because he thought I tried to show up[1]. At the time, a junior developer speaking something big like that was just simply unacceptable!</p><p>I felt uncomfortable with that kind of request, but finally wrote the email as he wanted. But from that day, my view about him and the team changed. I think I should be somehow aware of my aggressiveness and should find another way to say so that people feel easier to accept. But I also expect my manager to at least know what are the differences between showing up and the protective actions when someone loves something so much.</p><p>Later, the project got the same complaint from the customer and it’s well accepted, everyone rushed into fixing the issues, no one had ever complained simply because that’s from the customer.</p><p>I became a manager some years later and there were a couple of valued lessons I learned from that day and still use them till today.</p><p>The first thing is the way we say something is even more important than what we say.</p><p>Secondly, I believe understanding the motivations behind the actions, will help a manager very much in defining appropriate actions to help his people to grow. And the only way to achieve this is to "empathize" with them.</p><p>Thirdly, I believe there’s nothing wrong with showing up. And as a manager, our duty is not to criticize but to encourage, provide help and create an environment for them to grow.</p><hr class="delimiter"><p>[1] show up: this is the word that many people in my company use for talking about people who try to show their strength with others to get "attention" from their upper managers for promotion or other purposes.</p></div>
